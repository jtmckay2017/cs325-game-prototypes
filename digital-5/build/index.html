        <h2>Deserted</h2>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
        This game will be a base defense game set on a fixed grid. You will be able to create different unique types of fortifications to defend against incoming enemies (undecided on what kind of enemy).        
        <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
        Has many systems working together. This first prototype isn't as advanced as the later versions of the game will be.  However, I have a strong foundation.
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
        Weird bugs really slowed me down this time.
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
        Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

        <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
        Defend against rounds of enemies by creating a secure base. ( BASE BUILDING IN NEXT ITERATION )
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
        Isolation
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
        Different style of game from the games I've made before.
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
        Building / Tower Defense
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
        Come up with interesting strategies to protect their base from baddies.
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
        The game will be a top-down 2d grid base defender game.  The player will have to place walls and turrets to protect the center core of their base.  The player will be able to move up, down, left, and right around the map. They may be able to shoot, but will have to do further testing to see how it works with the other mechanics.        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
        Not sure until more parts of the game are decided on.
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
        Game is abstract. However I would like to add music that changes when fighting and building to add tension.
        </li>
