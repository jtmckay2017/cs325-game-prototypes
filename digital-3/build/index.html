        <h2>Laundromat Royal</h2>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
        This game is about collecting more clothes then the other team! It implements multiplayer with client-server model. 
        
        <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
        This was way more technical than I first thought it was going to be.<br>
        Client-Server model game using express.js and socket.io to send realtime data back and forth.<br>
        Server hosted on AWS EC2 instance so anyone can connect over the internet.
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
        I think I bet off a bit more than I could chew but I the tutorial I followed to set it up was easy and informative.  However getting my server onto
        aws was a bit of a challege.  Luckily I have work experience with all of these things so It made the process much smoother.
