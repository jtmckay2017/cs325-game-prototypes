<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game uses the artillary mechanic to skillfully shoot down poops with toilet paper.

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I mainly focused on the background workings of the game to be able to reuse in later games.
1. Easy way to load assets and loading scene with info.
2. Seperate files to store each scene.
3. Reusable main menu.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
How to setup Phaser 3 and a semi-complicated game setup.
The most difficult part was porting everything over to Phaser 3 and getting my code
to compile with out errors
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Take down the invading poop with your infinite supply of toilet paper.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Man most not get poop on him.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Only need to use the mouse to aim your gun.
Poop is spawned at random speeds and up-down velocitys.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Skill based shooting with an artillery style.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want to get a small laugh and quick enjoyment from the low-skill based shoot-em-up.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The core mechanic is to use your mouse to point and click to shoot at incoming <b>projectiles</b>.  
Do not let the poop get to your white line or the game is over!
You have a shot delay to be careful when choosing your shot.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player will always make sure he is fire at all times to get the most toilet paper out at once. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Tom is not feeling well today, and the only way to get out of this alive is to defeat the deadly ache!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone, the game has a low barrier of entry.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Endless, as long as you can survive.
</li>
